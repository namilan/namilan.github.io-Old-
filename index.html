    <p>If there is something you must know about me, it's my absolute love of learning things new. I grew up with a camera in my hands from when I was a
    little tiny human, and would never put it down. I wanted to learn more, so I dove ( head first, might I add ) into the world of Graphic Design. After 
    Graphic Design, I wanted to learn more about how programs ran, so here I am. <b>Java</b>. I thought to myself it was pure insanity to learn the bin about 4 months, how
 yet. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I was raised in a suburb of Columbus, OH, but firmly planted in Westerville, OH. I am 35 years old, with three tiny sassy humans, two cute dogs, and 
    a husband who shares his love of code with me. </p>
